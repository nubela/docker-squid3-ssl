Docker-Squid3-SSL
=================
A Squid3 caching proxy (with SSL enabled) in a Docker container.


Details
-------
* Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander).
* Squid (Version 3.3.8).
* Built from source, with --enable-ssl.
* Automatically generates self-signed certificate.
* Configured to cache Docker images (default config for Squid3 doesn't handle Docker images very well.)


Building the Squid3 Proxy Docker Image
--------------------------------------
Clone the git repo and cd into the root directory.

    # git clone https://github.com/nubela/docker-squid3-ssl
    # cd docker-squid3-ssl

Building the `squid3-ssl` Docker image is a 1-step process.

    # ./build.sh

The first step creates a `squid3-ssl-build` Docker image, whose purpose is to compile Squid3 from source, produce Debian packages, and copy the `.deb` files to the `debs` directory on the host filesystem.

The second step will generate a private key (`private.pem`) and a self-signed certificate (`proxy.docker.dev.crt`) and copy them into the `certs` directory. The self-signed certificate has the `commonName` of `proxy.docker.dev`.

The third step uses the Debian packages from the first step to create the `squid3-ssl` image.

By breaking up the build process into multiple steps, it's easy to create a small `squid3-ssl` image. Otherwise, if we built from source and installed it on the same image, we would have a lot of packages installed (gcc, etc.) that aren't needed for running Squid, only for building it.


Running the Squid3 Proxy
------------------------
To start Squid3 and set up port forwarding:

    # ./run.sh


Using the Squid3 Proxy
----------------------
### Trust the Self-signed Certificate
To use the proxy, your computer needs to trust the self-signed certificate. To install the CA certificate on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

    # "proxy.docker.dev.crt" is the name of the self-signed certificate.
    $ sudo cp proxy.docker.dev.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates
    $ sudo sh -c 'echo "proxy.docker.dev.crt" >> /etc/ca-certificates.conf'
    $ sudo /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates --fresh

Consult [this page](http://mitmproxy.org/doc/ssl.html) for instructions how to install on a different OS.


### Add Entry in /etc/hosts
In addition, your computer needs to be able to resolve the name of the proxy. The easiest way to achieve this is to add an entry in `/etc/hosts` for the proxy.

*Note: The name of the proxy must be the same as the `commonName` in the certificate.*

    # Example entry in /etc/hosts/
    192.168.31.28   proxy.docker.dev


### Is it Working?
Run this command twice and check the `X-Cache` header that Squid sets in the reponses. The second response should show a cache hit.

    $ curl -s -i -x http://proxy.docker.dev:3128 https://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
    X-Cache: MISS from 54ab989722f0

    $ curl -s -i -x http://proxy.docker.dev:3128 https://httpbin.org/ip | grep 'X-Cache:'
    X-Cache: HIT from 54ab989722f0
